## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

* Things went fairly well once I decided to switch back to longer working intervals. Having tried 25 min working stints in the past, I knew they didn't work well for me as I get easily distracted and take some time to get into a flow state. I was distracted by having to set timers and record notes for the Poms.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

* When using 25 min working intervals, I was very distracted and inefficient. It's key for me to get into a flow state, and 25 min intervals makes that tough. Other than getting stuck on the classMethods.js exercise for a bit, I much better at estimating timing with 50 min working intervals.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

* An object is a way to store complex data similar to an array. While an array uses a simple ordered list, an object uses key value pairs that reflect a key, along with an associated value.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: **Array**: this appears to be requesting a simple ordered list
  * List of states and their capitals: **Object**: you can connect the two via key-value pairs
  * List of things to pack for vacation: **Object**: this list seems like it would benefit from key-value pairs as multiples of some items will be needed
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: **Array**: this appears to be requesting a simple ordered list
  * List of student names and their cohort: **Object**: need to associate the value of cohort with the the student names
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: **Object**: you are working with key-value pairs here
  * All my favorite restaurants: **Array**: this appears to be requesting a simple ordered list

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

* One web app I use frequently is the weather channel, which uses an object for the day's forecast. The instance would be the day of the week, and keys (and example values) would include highTemperature: 65, lowTemperature: 45, averageWind: 5, rainChance: 10, etc.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

* None at this time
