## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I was aware of most of these, but it is nice to revisit and add some context. From this list, I definitely already try to take care of my brain with a healthy diet and ample sleep. I also try, when possible, to teach others concepts as I definitely agree this helps to retain/master new concepts. Going forward, I would like to read more, and made a simple schedule for myself to read more before starting this program. I would also like to take more breaks, and embrace an existing technique like Pomodoro.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* String: Letters and other characters wrapped in single or double quotes
* Number: Numeric values, including negative and decimal (called floating point) values
* Boolean: Values of true or false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```
console.log("Hello World!");
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

 You would use two slashes to indicate a comment and remove it from being processed as code. EX: `//` . The purpose of a code comment is to communicate information, such as intentions and reasoning, to humans that have access to the code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a representation of another value. It must first be declared, and then can be assigned a new value at any time.

To a five year old, I would say an emptyCup variable without any marbles in it has a value of 0. If we put two marbles in it, it now has a value of 2.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use the reddit site frequently. Three variables and their corresponding data types could be: 1. username (string) 2. password (string) 3. subreddit (string)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the joining of multiple values to become one value.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

For the weather channel app, the developers likely concatenate different weather data points like temperature and wind speed together when returning results for your zip code.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
The only question I think I still have is where, and how, 'const' and 'let' are used in place of 'var'. I understand this will be covered in the future.
