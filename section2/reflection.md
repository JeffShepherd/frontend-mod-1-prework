## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

* I am generally hesitant to ask questions, as I feel that I should be able to figure things out on my own. I also am a very detail-oriented person, and feel that I often get answers that are too vague. as a result of this, I definitely wait too long to ask questions.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

* I didn't have any issue with this. Having to dig for answers, and fail while working, really helps with the learning process. I find that I understand concepts better when I struggle through them.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* A conditional statement is used to evaluate a condition, and determine what should happen depending on the evaluation.
* Daily life example: picking weather-appropriate clothing. If the temperature is greater than 60, wear shorts. If not, wear pants.
* Web app example:

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

* In order to add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, you would use if/else statements. By doing this, the program looks at the first statement, and if conditions are met, it executes the code block. If conditions are not met, the program moves down to the next `else` or `if/else` statement and evaluates the conditions. The code block will execute if conditions are met, or it will continue this process until the last `else` statement is evaluated.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

* If you want to check that two conditions are met, you can use the `&&` operator. This represents the AND operation, and will evaluate two conditions.
* If you want to check that one of two conditions are met, you can use the `||` operator. This represents the OR operation, and will evaluate that 1 of 2 conditions are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

* None so far. I was questioning how many AND OR operators could be used together, but I used chrome dev tools to run some experiments.
