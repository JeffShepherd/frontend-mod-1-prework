## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* This resonated with me: those with a growth mindset are not afraid to ask questions and seek information/constructive feedback from others. Being that constantly seeking challenges is part of a growth mindset, you will inevitably hit issues that need outside input when working on new things.

* One new point was to focus on your progress and track it as a way to look back on how far you have come. This can inspire you to keep growing. Try not to compare yourself to others as they may learn faster, which can discourage you.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I currently demonstrate a growth mindset by always embracing challenges. As a new student to coding, I try to keep enthusiasm as new problems present themselves.

* I am working on being more open to asking more questions, and seeking feedback, earlier in the process. My tendency is to wait too long to answer questions, as I feel I should be able to figure the challenge out.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* One web app I use regularly that likely uses arrays is Gmail. Gmail uses an array that lists all of the folders I have created for a specific email account.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

* An array method is a method built into JavaScript that lets you edit an array. This could include adding, removing, and many other actions.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* The purposed of a loop is to simplify repeated code when it performs a similar, or the same process, in multiple lines.

* A loop is used with an array when working with a list of items. If there is only one item, then there is likely no need to use an array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* A loop is a way to do the same thing over and over until you want it to stop. Before you start doing it, you say when you want it to stop, and stop when that thing happens.

* An example would be to hold five fingers up and put one down each time I say go. Once there are no fingers left, the loop is over.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* No questions, but I am interested in learning more of the methods that interact with arrays in various ways.
